Provide awesome experience to view code coverage data in VS Code which is collected by "dotnet test"

Idea inspired by  [Scott Hanselman blog](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/AutomaticUnitTestingInNETCorePlusCodeCoverageInVisualStudioCode.aspx)  and .NET Core developers( special thanks to @sesispla for bringing blog to our attention)  ask from [vstest issue](https://github.com/Microsoft/vstest/issues/981)
